# timeTracker
Track your time with this minimalist React task app

### Motivation 
I built this tool to help me accurately allot time to tasks. The app tracks the time it takes to complete a task and your prediction of how much time it'll take in a really refined UI.

### To Do

Roughing the edges
- [ ] genuine warning
- [ ] genuine export
- [ ] counter button responsive
- [ ] colon between times
- [ ] label for two inputs over time fields
- [ ] pause

Features
- [ ] budgeting - put in multiple tasks and begin a chain of timers
- [ ] continue tasks
- [ ] tasks within projects
- [ ] tags

Dashboard
- [ ] % of tasks complete before expected
- [ ] char of expectations vs time to complete
- [ ] histogram of length of tasks (Is user predicting shorter/longer tasks tasks more accurately ?)
- [ ] most common tags
- [ ] which tags are complete most often on time, which ones not
